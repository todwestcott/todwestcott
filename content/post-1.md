## The Futility of Judgment
No man or woman can determine your eternal fate by his judgment of you. Other people judging you have no impact or weight at all and how the Lord sees and judges you. Therefore, do not be concerned at all with how others judge you. Unless you find some instruction in their judgment and your heeding it results in your improvement. The only judgment that can hurt you is your judgment of others. Those who judge you harm themselves and your judgments harm you. Your  judgments put such a weight on your soul that it makes it impossible for you to ascend to heaven after physical death. Your judgments condemn you.

But the judgments of other men weigh on you far less than the lightest floating feather. Jesus was judged by a large group of men so venomously that he was sentenced to heinous death. But what did these judgments of these self approved men have to do with the fate of his eternal soul? They had no impact at all. God did not consider them or evaluate them or use them in his assessment of Jesus. Indeed, he found Jesus worthy because Jesus did not fill himself with judgments in response to those who judged him. So how they judged Jesus had no merit at all. And Jesus was free and liberated to reside with God because he himself was free of judgment.

## The Error of Judgment
When we stand before Jesus on Judgment Day we are judged by the judgments we hold. And we are free to join him and the father only if it our flesh heart mind soul and spirit are free of judgment.

We fall into the trap of thinking that others deserve our negative judgment. But God does not consult us to determine how others should be judged. Therefore our judgment has no weight, utility or purpose. It is only a stain in our heart which defiles our holy nature and condemns us to eternal separation from God. Therefore waste no time or energy in judging others. Be like Jesus, loving others so much, regardless and in spite of their sins, that you are willing to make a sacrifice of your self so that they are forgiven.

Our lives are consumed with judgment of others. But it turns out that our judgments are completely empty of merit. They are self-contained within us and have no impact on others. The only weight and impact they have is on ourselves to the point of eternal condemnation.
